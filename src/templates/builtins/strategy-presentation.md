## Instructions

You are creating a Strategy Presentation. This is an executive-level document used to communicate strategic direction, key decisions, and roadmap to leadership and stakeholders.

## Document Structure

Build the document with these sections in order:

1. **Title Slide** - Presentation title, subtitle, presenter name, date
2. **Agenda** - Brief outline of what will be covered
3. **Executive Summary** - 3-5 key takeaways upfront so leadership knows the punchline
4. **Current State** - Where we are today:
   - Key metrics and performance data
   - Market position
   - Customer/user insights
5. **Challenges & Opportunities** - What's working, what's not, and what's changed:
   - Internal challenges
   - External market shifts
   - Emerging opportunities
6. **Strategic Vision** - Where we want to go:
   - North star / vision statement
   - Strategic pillars (3-5 key themes)
   - How this connects to company/org goals
7. **Proposed Strategy** - How we get there:
   - Key initiatives per strategic pillar
   - Prioritization framework
   - Trade-offs and what we're choosing NOT to do
8. **Roadmap** - High-level timeline:
   - Near-term (this quarter)
   - Medium-term (next 2 quarters)
   - Long-term (next year)
9. **Resource Requirements** - Team, budget, and infrastructure needs
10. **Risks & Mitigations** - Key risks with concrete mitigation plans
11. **Success Metrics** - How we measure progress and success
12. **Call to Action / Next Steps** - What decisions are needed and from whom
13. **Appendix** - Supporting data, detailed analysis, references

## Style Guidelines

- Lead with insights, not data - tell the story first, support with evidence
- Use the "so what?" test for every slide - make the implication clear
- Keep text minimal - use visuals, charts, and frameworks where possible
- Use consistent formatting: titles as assertions ("Revenue grew 40% YoY" not "Revenue Data")
- Limit to 3-5 bullets per slide maximum
- Include speaker notes with talking points and supporting details

## Host-Specific Instructions

For **PowerPoint**: This is the primary format. Use `add_slide_from_code` for slides with charts, tables, or custom layouts. Use title + content layouts for most slides. Include detailed speaker notes. Keep slides visually clean with plenty of white space.

For **Word**: Create a narrative version. Use headings for sections, include inline data and tables, and write in a flowing document style rather than bullet-point format.

## Getting Started

Before building the presentation, ask the user:
1. What is the strategic topic or area? (e.g., product strategy, team strategy, go-to-market)
2. Who is the audience? (e.g., C-suite, VP-level, board, team)
3. What decisions or alignment are you seeking?
4. Are there any key data points, metrics, or prior materials to incorporate?
